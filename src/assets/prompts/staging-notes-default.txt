    <task>Extract staging notes describing the CURRENT STATE at the end of this content. This content represents everything written BEFORE the next story beat - your notes will help maintain continuity for what comes next.</task>
    <important>
      - Only describe the final/current state at the END of this content
      - Do NOT describe how things changed or evolved - only the current state
      - Omit any details that are no longer relevant (e.g., if a character left, don't include them)
      - Include only what matters for continuing the narrative from this point
    </important>
    <focus>
      - Character positions (where each character currently is in the space)
      - Character proximity (note if characters are close together or distant from each other, when relevant for the narrative)
      - Character clothing and appearance (state important/distinctive features concisely - e.g., "wearing a torn red dress, barefoot" - skip generic details)
      - Character states (posture, what they're holding, emotional demeanor if visible)
      - Object placements (relevant items and where they are now)
      - Environmental details (current lighting, weather, time of day)
      - Physical scene setup (room layout, furniture, relevant props)
    </focus>
    <format>Write concise bullet points. Use present tense. Describe only the current state. Do NOT use headings, section titles, markdown formatting, or categories - just a flat list of bullet points.</format>
    {languageInstruction}
{customInstruction}
    <responseFormat>Output ONLY plain bullet points (using - or •). No headings, no bold text, no categories, no markdown. Just simple bullet points listing the staging details.</responseFormat>
