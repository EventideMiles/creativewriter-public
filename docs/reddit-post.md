## Draft Post

**Title suggestion (if standalone post):** CreativeWriter - Open Source AI Writing Tool Gets Character Chat Feature

---

**Post Body:**

Hey writers!

I wanted to share an update on **CreativeWriter**, the open-source AI writing tool I've been building. The latest release just dropped with a feature I'm really excited about: **Character Chat**.

### What's Character Chat?

Ever wanted to interview your characters? Now you can have actual conversations with them. The AI responds in-character, aware of their personality, background, and what they'd realistically know from your story. It's been incredibly useful for:

- Exploring character motivations before writing difficult scenes
- Testing if dialogue feels authentic to the character
- Discovering backstory details you hadn't consciously planned
- Getting unstuck when you're not sure how a character would react

### The App (Quick Overview)

For those unfamiliar - CreativeWriter is a **free, open-source, self-hostable** writing app with AI assistance. Core features include:

- Full story structure (acts, chapters, scenes, beats)
- Dynamic codex for tracking characters, locations, plot elements
- AI scene generation from outlines
- Works with multiple AI providers (OpenRouter, Claude, Gemini, **Ollama for local models**)
- Offline-first with optional sync
- Story analysis tools (cliché detector, character consistency checker)

All of that remains **completely free**.

### On Premium Features

With this release, I've introduced optional premium features (starting at $0.99/month). I want to be transparent about why:

Building and maintaining this has been a labor of love, but advanced features like Character Chat require significant ongoing effort - not just to build, but to refine and improve based on feedback. Premium is a way to keep development sustainable and fund new features that take the app further.

The core will always be free and open source. Premium is simply for those who find value in the advanced features and want to support continued development. No pressure, no paywalls on essential functionality.

Happy writing!

## Notes

1. **Customize the links** - Add your actual GitHub repo URL and any web demo URL
2. **Adjust length** - Weekly tools threads sometimes have character limits, this can be trimmed
3. **Consider adding a screenshot** - Character Chat UI would make it more engaging
4. **Response prep** - Be ready to answer questions about:
   - What AI providers work best
   - Self-hosting requirements
   - How it compares to NovelCrafter (you have import support)
