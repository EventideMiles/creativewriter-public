CreativeWriter 2 v1.4.202509301106 – Outline workspace, scene generation, and smarter research

## Post Body
Hey storytellers 👋

I just pushed CreativeWriter 2 v1.4.202509301106 live and it’s a huge quality-of-life jump for anyone juggling chapters, research, and AI helpers.

**What’s new**
- New Outline Overview workspace with inline editing, search, and one-tap AI summaries/titles.
- “Create Scene from Outline” modal that turns bullet notes into fully written scenes (25k-word target, custom prompts, cancel/continue controls).
- Story Research workbench that runs tasks across scenes in parallel, keeps histories, and links results straight into the editor.
- Scene Chat now remembers up to five sessions per story—you can branch from any earlier message or resend prompts.
- Inspector gains a Character Consistency analyzer that jumps straight to highlighted text in the editor.
- Central model favorites in Settings so your best models surface across Beat AI, summaries, and scene generation.
